This app, "alphabetic_sign_language1," uses your phone's camera to recognize American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet signs in real-time.
Developed with Python for the machine learning model and Java for deployment, the app displays the recognized sign on the screen and includes a text-to-speech feature to vocalize the detected signs. 
Simply open the app, allow camera access, and start signing to see and hear the ASL alphabet in action.
